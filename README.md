Analysis on covid-19 dataset

Problem Statement:
Given data about COVID-19 patients, write code to visualize the impact and analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current trends.

Dataset:
CSV and Excel files containing data about the number of COVID-19 confirmed deaths and recovered patients both around the world and in India. 

Guidelines:
● Use pandas to accumulate data from multiple data files.
● Use plotly (visualization library) to create interactive visualizations.
● Use Facebook prophet library to make time series models.
● Visualize the prediction by combining these technologies.
